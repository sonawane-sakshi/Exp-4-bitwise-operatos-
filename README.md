<h1>Theory</h1>
<p>Bitwise operators in C++ perform operations at the binary level, directly manipulating the bits of integer data types. These operators include AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), and bitwise shifts (<<, >>). Understanding bitwise operators is essential for tasks requiring low-level data processing, such as optimizing performance or managing binary data.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Through our experiment with C++ bitwise operators, we demonstrated their ability to efficiently manipulate individual bits of data. This understanding is crucial for tasks that require precise control over data at the binary level.</p>
